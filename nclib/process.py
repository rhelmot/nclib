class Process(Netcat):
    """
    A mechanism for launching a local process and interacting with it
    programatically.  This class is a subclass of the basic `Netcat` object so
    you may use any method from that class to interact with the process you've
    launched!

    :param program:     The program to launch. Can be either a list of strings,
                        in which case those strings will become the program
                        argv, or a single string, in which case the shell will
                        be used to launch the program.
    :param stderr:      How the program's stderr stream should behave. True
                        (default) will redirect stderr to the output socket,
                        unifying it with stdout. False will redirect it to
                        /dev/null. None will not touch it, causing it to appear
                        on your terminal.
    :param cwd:         The working directory to execute the program in
    :param env:         The environment to execute the program in, as a
                        dictionary
    :param protocol:    The socket protocol to use. 'tcp' by default, can also
                        be 'udp'

    Any additional keyword arguments will be passed to the constructor of
    Netcat.

    WARNING: If you provide a string and not a list as the description for the
    program to launch, then the pid we know about will be associated with the
    shell that launches the program, not the program itself.

    *Example:* Launch the `cat` process and send it a greeting. Print out its
    response. Close the socket and the process exits with status 0.

    >>> from nclib import Process
    >>> cat = Process('cat')
    >>> cat.send('Hello world!')
    >>> print cat.recv()
    Hello world!
    >>> cat.close()
    >>> print cat.poll()
